{% include toc icon="columns" %}

In this project, you will create an Azure IoT Hub, connect IoT DevKit to it, and collect the temperature and humidity data from sensors and send the data to the IoT hub.

## What you learn

* How to create an IoT Hub and register a device for MXChip IoT DevKit.
* How to collect sensor data by running a sample application on MXChip IoT DevKit.
* How to send the sensor data to your IoT hub.

## What you need

Finish the [Getting Started Guide]({{"/docs/get-started/" | absolute_url }}) to:

* Have your IoT evKit connected to Wi-Fi
* Prepare the development environment

An active Azure subscription. If you do not have one, you can register via one of the methods:

* Activate a [free 30-day trial Microsoft Azure account](https://azureinfo.microsoft.com/us-freetrial.html){:target="_blank"}
* Claim your [Azure credit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/){:target="_blank"} if you are MSDN or Visual Studio subscriber

## Use Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is the primary development tool for IoT DevKit. If this is the first time you learn about Visual Studio Code, there are a series of [Getting Started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) tutorials are dedicated for it.

## Step 1. Open the project folder

### A. Start VS Code

Make sure your IoT DevKit is not connected. Start VS Code first and connect the IoT DevKit to your computer. VS Code automatically finds the IoT DevKit and opens an introduction page:

![Introduction page]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/vscode_start.png" | absolute_url }})

**Notice:** Occasionally, when you launch VS Code, you are prompted with error that cannot find Arduino IDE or related board package. Close VS Code, launch Arduino IDE once again, and VS Code should locate Arduino IDE path correctly.
{: .notice--warning}

### B. Open the Arduino Examples folder

Expand left side **ARDUINO EXAMPLES** section, browse to **Examples for MXCHIP AZ3166 > AzureIoT**, and select **GetStarted**. This will open a new VS Code window with project folder in it.

![Arduino Examples tab]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/vscode_examples.png" | absolute_url }})

If you happen to close the pane, you can reopen it. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` (macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`) to open the command palette, type **Arduino**, and then find and select **Arduino: Examples**.

## Step 2. Provision Azure services

1. In the solution window, run your task through `Ctrl+P` (macOS: `Cmd+P`) by entering `task cloud-provision`: In the VS Code terminal, an interactive command line guides you through provisioning the required Azure services:

    ![Interactive command line]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/cloud-provision.png" | absolute_url }})

    **Notice:** If the page hangs in the loading status when trying to sign in to Azure, please check this [FAQ steps]({{"/docs/faq/#page-hangs-when-log-in-azure" | absolute_url}}) to solve it. 
    {: .notice--warning}

2. When a list of Azure subscriptions display in the terminal, use the **up** and **down** arrow keys to select the Azure subscription that you will use to provision the Azure IoT Hub. Then press **Enter** to confirm the selected subscription.

    ![Select Azure subscription]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/select-subscription.png" | absolute_url }})

3. Provision IoT Hub
      * If you've provisioned IoT Hub(s) before, a list of IoT Hubs associated with the subscription appears in the terminal. Please use **up** and **down** arrow keys to select one from the list and press **Enter** to confirm.

        ![Select an existing IoT Hub]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/select-existing-iothub.png" | absolute_url }})

        _Select existing Free IoT Hub_

        Wait several minutes to finish ARM Template deployment and IoT Hub Device provision. Then press any key to exit the terminal.

        ![Select an existing IoT Hub done]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/select-iothub-done.png" | absolute_url }})

        _Finish selecting IoT Hub_

      * If you don't have any IoT Hub, please follow the steps to create a free IoT Hub:
      
        * Resource group provision:
          Use **up** and **down** arrow keys to choose a resource group you've created before or select **Create New...** to provision a new resource group. Complete the resource group provision according to the command line prompt.

          ![Select or create Azure resource group]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/select-or-create-resource-group.png" | absolute_url }})

          If you choose to create a new resource group:
          * Use **up** and **down** arrow keys to select region for a new resource group provision, and then press **Enter** to confirm.

            ![Select region for a new resource group]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/select-region-for-resource-group.png" | absolute_url }})

            _Select region for resource group provision_

          * Input a name for new resource group.

            ![Input name for resource group]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/input-name-for-resource-group.png" | absolute_url }})

            _Input a name for resource group provision_

        * IoT Hub provision:

          Enter a name for your new IoT Hub, and press **Enter** to confirm.

          ![Input a name for IoT Hub]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/input-name-for-iothub.png" | absolute_url }})

          _Input a name for IoT Hub provision_

          Wait several minutes to finish ARM Template deployment and IoT Hub Device provision. Then press any key to exit the terminal.
